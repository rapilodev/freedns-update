Description: freedns-update
 This service frequently checks your ip by using ip checker services in the web and 
 updates one or multiple freedns_accounts with the detected IPs if they have changed.
 This package comes with an upstart job at /etc/init/freedns-update.conf.
 Logs will be written to /var/log/freedns-update/freedns-update.log and rotated by /etc/logrotate.d/freedns-update
